A collection of scripts I have used to assist me with tedious grinding on an online server in Minecraft.
Requires downloading minescript API (found online), along with a smooth_look and minescript_plus script that is not mine.
Imports: minescript, minescript_plus, smooth_look, asyncio, time, threading, random, sys, requests
